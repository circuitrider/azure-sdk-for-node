/**
 * @summary A Task which is run when a Node joins a Pool in the Azure Batch
 * service, or when the Compute Node is rebooted or reimaged.
  *
 * Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node.
 * Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an
 * unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host
 * failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not
 * counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0,
 * an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this,
 * all Tasks should be idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being
 * interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data.
 * The best practice for long running Tasks is to use some form of
 * checkpointing. In some cases the start Task may be re-run even though the
 * Compute Node was not rebooted. Special care should be taken to avoid start
 * Tasks which create breakaway process or install/launch services from the
 * start Task working directory, as this will block Batch from being able to
 * re-run the start Task.

class StartTask {
  /**
   * Create a StartTask.
   * @property {string} commandLine The command line of the start Task. The
   * command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take
   * advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you
   * want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in
   * the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or
   * "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If the command line refers to file paths,
   * it should use a relative path (relative to the Task working directory), or
   * use the Batch provided environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @property {object} [containerSettings] The settings for the container
   * under which the start Task runs. When this is specified, all directories
   * recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of Azure Batch
   * directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all Task
   * environment variables are mapped into the container, and the Task command
   * line is executed in the container. Files produced in the container outside
   * of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be reflected to the host disk, meaning
   * that Batch file APIs will not be able to access those files.
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These
   * additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.imageName] This is the full Image
   * reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is provided
   * as part of the Image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a default.
   * @property {object} [containerSettings.registry] This setting can be
   * omitted if was already provided at Pool creation.
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.registry.registryServer] If omitted,
   * the default is "docker.io".
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @property {string} [containerSettings.workingDirectory] The default is
   * 'taskWorkingDirectory'. Possible values include: 'taskWorkingDirectory',
   * 'containerImageDefault'
   * @property {array} [resourceFiles] A list of files that the Batch service
   * will download to the Compute Node before running the command line.  There
   * is a maximum size for the list of resource files. When the max size is
   * exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be
   * RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles
   * must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files,
   * Application Packages, or Docker Containers. Files listed under this
   * element are located in the Task's working directory.
   * @property {array} [environmentSettings] A list of environment variable
   * settings for the start Task.
   * @property {object} [userIdentity] The user identity under which the start
   * Task runs. If omitted, the Task runs as a non-administrative user unique
   * to the Task.
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.userName] The userName and autoUser
   * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
   * @property {object} [userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and autoUser
   * properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not both.
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default value is
   * Task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @property {string} [userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The default
   * value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
   * @property {number} [maxTaskRetryCount] The maximum number of times the
   * Task may be retried. The Batch service retries a Task if its exit code is
   * nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries.
   * The Batch service will try the Task once, and may then retry up to this
   * limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task
   * up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count
   * is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task. If the maximum retry
   * count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit.
   * @property {boolean} [waitForSuccess] Whether the Batch service should wait
   * for the start Task to complete successfully (that is, to exit with exit
   * code 0) before scheduling any Tasks on the Compute Node. If true and the
   * start Task fails on a Node, the Batch service retries the start Task up to
   * its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the Task has still not
   * completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the
   * Node unusable, and will not schedule Tasks to it. This condition can be
   * detected via the Compute Node state and failure info details. If false,
   * the Batch service will not wait for the start Task to complete. In this
   * case, other Tasks can start executing on the Compute Node while the start
   * Task is still running; and even if the start Task fails, new Tasks will
   * continue to be scheduled on the Compute Node. The default is false.
