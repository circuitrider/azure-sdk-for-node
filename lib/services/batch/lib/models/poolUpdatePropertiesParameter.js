class PoolUpdatePropertiesParameter {
  /**
   * Create a PoolUpdatePropertiesParameter.
   * @property {object} [startTask] A Task to run on each Compute Node as it
   * joins the Pool. The Task runs when the Compute Node is added to the Pool
   * or when the Compute Node is restarted. If this element is present, it
   * overwrites any existing start Task. If omitted, any existing start Task is
   * removed from the Pool.
   * @property {string} [startTask.commandLine] The command line does not run
   * under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such
   * as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such
   * features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example
   * using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux. If
   * the command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path
   * (relative to the Task working directory), or use the Batch provided
   * environment variable
   * (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
   * @property {object} [startTask.containerSettings] When this is specified,
   * all directories recursively below the AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR (the root of
   * Azure Batch directories on the node) are mapped into the container, all
   * Task environment variables are mapped into the container, and the Task
   * command line is executed in the container. Files produced in the container
   * outside of AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIR might not be reflected to the host disk,
   * meaning that Batch file APIs will not be able to access those files.
   * @property {string} [startTask.containerSettings.containerRunOptions] These
   * additional options are supplied as arguments to the "docker create"
   * command, in addition to those controlled by the Batch Service.
   * @property {string} [startTask.containerSettings.imageName] This is the
   * full Image reference, as would be specified to "docker pull". If no tag is
   * provided as part of the Image name, the tag ":latest" is used as a
   * default.
   * @property {object} [startTask.containerSettings.registry] This setting can
   * be omitted if was already provided at Pool creation.
   * @property {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.registryServer]
   * If omitted, the default is "docker.io".
   * @property {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.userName]
   * @property {string} [startTask.containerSettings.registry.password]
   * @property {string} [startTask.containerSettings.workingDirectory] The
   * default is 'taskWorkingDirectory'. Possible values include:
   * 'taskWorkingDirectory', 'containerImageDefault'
   * @property {array} [startTask.resourceFiles] Files listed under this
   * element are located in the Task's working directory.
   * @property {array} [startTask.environmentSettings]
   * @property {object} [startTask.userIdentity] If omitted, the Task runs as a
   * non-administrative user unique to the Task.
   * @property {string} [startTask.userIdentity.userName] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @property {object} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser] The userName and
   * autoUser properties are mutually exclusive; you must specify one but not
   * both.
   * @property {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.scope] The default
   * value is Task. Possible values include: 'task', 'pool'
   * @property {string} [startTask.userIdentity.autoUser.elevationLevel] The
   * default value is nonAdmin. Possible values include: 'nonAdmin', 'admin'
   * @property {number} [startTask.maxTaskRetryCount] The Batch service retries
   * a Task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically
   * controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the Task once,
   * and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry
   * count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3
   * retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not
   * retry the Task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service
   * retries the Task without limit.
   * @property {boolean} [startTask.waitForSuccess] If true and the start Task
   * fails on a Node, the Batch service retries the start Task up to its
   * maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the Task has still not
   * completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the
   * Node unusable, and will not schedule Tasks to it. This condition can be
   * detected via the Compute Node state and failure info details. If false,
   * the Batch service will not wait for the start Task to complete. In this
   * case, other Tasks can start executing on the Compute Node while the start
   * Task is still running; and even if the start Task fails, new Tasks will
   * continue to be scheduled on the Compute Node. The default is false.
   * @property {array} certificateReferences A list of Certificates to be
   * installed on each Compute Node in the Pool. This list replaces any
   * existing Certificate references configured on the Pool. If you specify an
   * empty collection, any existing Certificate references are removed from the
   * Pool. For Windows Nodes, the Batch service installs the Certificates to
   * the specified Certificate store and location. For Linux Compute Nodes, the
   * Certificates are stored in a directory inside the Task working directory
   * and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the
   * Task to query for this location. For Certificates with visibility of
   * 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory
   * (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and Certificates are placed in that
   * directory.
   * @property {array} applicationPackageReferences The list of Application
   * Packages to be installed on each Compute Compute Node in the Pool. The
   * list replaces any existing Application Package references on the Pool.
   * Changes to Application Package references affect all new Compute Nodes
   * joining the Pool, but do not affect Compute Compute Nodes that are already
   * in the Pool until they are rebooted or reimaged. There is a maximum of 10
   * Application Package references on any given Pool. If omitted, or if you
   * specify an empty collection, any existing Application Packages references
   * are removed from the Pool. A maximum of 10 references may be specified on
   * a given Pool.
   * @property {array} metadata A list of name-value pairs associated with the
   * Pool as metadata. This list replaces any existing metadata configured on
   * the Pool. If omitted, or if you specify an empty collection, any existing
   * metadata is removed from the Pool.
